# echium_photo_portfolio

This is a photo journal that I've made using React, Yet Another React Lightbox and Firebase.

## Installation

If you would like to clone this repo onto your own machine to create your own photo journal, please follow the instructions below. And if you want to continue using Firebase as a backend, then you'll need to setup your own Firebase project with a Firestore database (with its own rules). You will also need to create a .env at the root of the project with your Firebase project's keys etc.
