          At the beginning of April I went on holiday, which is something I
          haven&apos;t done since 2014/15 I can&apos;t remember the date
          exactly, but I can remember that it was pre-brexit.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was feeling anxious in the weeks leading up to departure, and the
          night before I didn&apos;t sleep well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Waking up at 3am to take a taxi to LBA, my mind felt murky and my
          mouth dry. We stumbled through departures and sat, slightly cold, at
          our gate waiting for boarding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flying was exciting! Well, more exciting than a ferry, which was the
          method of transit the last time I went abroad. After the initial
          excitement of taking off, the dullness of cruising sets in over 2
          hours, and I had forgot to bring my headphones...
        </p>
        <p>
          We arrived in Porto in the morning (actual morning, not before dawn
          morning), and after the faff of immigration/arrivals, we could begin
          to enjoy the holiday...which we absolutely did ðŸŒžðŸŒžðŸŒž
